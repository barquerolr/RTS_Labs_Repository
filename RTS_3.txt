If you could change 1 thing about your favorite framework/language/platform (pick one), what would it be?

Answer: I would change 1 main thing in regards to the C/C++ language: compiling threads.

In my multicore/multithread and operating systems class back at VCU, there was always an issue regarding compiling anything 
involving threads. Whether it was using notepad++ and then a MingW compilers on a terminal, or using Visual Studio, both would fail at 
compiling threads at their own rate. Notepad would not compile anything OMP related, Visual Studio would not compile pthreads related, so
to address this issue, I had to either use Linux, use my operating system class's Unix SSH server, or download CLion. 
So, while it sounds petty, I would change the C/C++ language so that compiling anything related to threads or multicore/multithreading
related is easier and smoother.
